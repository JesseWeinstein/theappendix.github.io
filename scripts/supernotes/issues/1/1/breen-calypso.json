Rowe. According to Rowe, on the day in question, ‘Miller was at the farm with his family, though how many were there we do not know… Family tradition holds that they waited praying on a large, flat outcropping just west of the farmhouse, today known as Ascension Rock… if so, they unfortunately have provided a tableau like the one scoffers have always projected—Millerites crowding the tops of hills and roofs of barns to be closer to Jesus when he appeared.’ Rowe says that in Miller’s journal all he reports is that they ‘held meeting all day and our place of worship was crowded to overflowing with anxious souls apparently.’ Certainly many people lost their faith in the aftermath of the Great Disappointment, but many Millerites looked to Miller and other Millerite leaders for an explanation of what had actually happened. Some groups with perfectionist tendencies claimed that Jesus had come on October 22, but that he had come spiritually within them, making it possible for them to perform miracles, etc. Joshua V. Himes, Miller’s right hand man, argued that they simply got the date wrong and kept hoping for Jesus to return soon. A third group claimed that a significant change had occurred in heaven and that on October 22, Jesus had entered the holiest of holies in the heavenly sanctuary. This group would eventually become the Seventh-day Adventists.”"]}]},{"paragraph":30,"notes":[{"type":"citation","notes":["Plutarch, Moralia, Vol. XII (“[Concerning the Face Which Appears in the Orb of the Moon](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/The_Face_in_the_Moon*/D.html)”), c.100 CE.","“Thick, luxuriant woods grew round the cave,/ alders, and black poplars, pungent cypress too,/ and there, birds roosted, folding their long wings,/ owls and hawks and the spread beaked ravens of the sea,/ black skimmers who make their living off the waves./ And round the mouth of the cavern trailed a vine/ laden with clusters, bursting with ripe grapes./ Four springs in a row, bubbling clear and cold,/ running side-by-side, took channels left and right./ Soft meadows spreading round were starred with violets,/ lush with beds of parsley.

The most famous example of this is likely Pompeii, but an even more striking instance comes from the Ancient Near East. The [Ebla tablets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebla_tablets) were created by palace scribes in the ancient city-state of Ebla in present-day Syria between 2500 BCE and c. 2250 BCE, when the city burnt to the ground in an enormous conflagration. The flames were so hot that they baked the tablets as if in a kiln. The tablets had been stored in order on wooden shelving, and as they collapsed they retained their original ordering system—indeed, many retained the identifying tags added by palace librarians, making them virtually unique in the corpus of surviving cuneiform texts. Ebla was destroyed, but the act of destruction preserved these records for posterity."]}]}]
