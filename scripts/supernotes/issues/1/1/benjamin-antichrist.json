[{"paragraph":2,"notes":[{"type":"commentary","notes":["Citation: RU 7058, Box 17 (National Institute, 1839-1863 and undated), Folder: Miscellany; SIA. Image negative reference number: SIA2012-9666.<br /><br />On the document’s discovery: our executive editor found it while flipping through a folder labeled “Miscellany” in the archives of the National Institute, stored in the <a href='http://siarchives.si.edu' target='_blank'>Smithsonian Institution Archives</a> in Washington, D.C. Chartered by Congress in 1842 as the National Institution for the Promotion of Science, the National Institute had some initial successes—displaying the objects collected by the Wilkes U.S. Exploring Expedition, for example—but the creation of Washington’s separate Smithsonian Institution in 1846 scuttled their larger hopes of becoming America’s national scientific institution. The National Institute declined until 1862, when it gave up its collections to the Smithsonian.<br /><br />None of which explains why this document was filed with the National Institute: it was written in 1866, four years after the National Institute’s dissolution. It might be that it was collected by one of the National Institute’s last members, and folded into the papers that were eventually handed over to the Smithsonian. It is certainly a curiosity.<br /><br />The lesson learned? Always look at the folder labeled “Miscellany.”"]}]},{"paragraph":11,"notes":[{"type":"image","notes":[{"url":"SIA2012-9667-downsampled.jpg","alt":"","caption":"","credit":"SIA Image negative reference number: SIA2012-9667"}]}]},{"paragraph":24,"notes":[{"type":"image","notes":[{"url":"SIA2012-9668-downsampled.jpg","alt":"","caption":"","credit":"SIA Image negative reference number: SIA2012-9668"}]}]},{"paragraph":28,"notes":[{"type":"image","notes":[{"url":"Prophet_Benjamin_Map.jpg","alt":"","caption":"The geological cataclysm, here portrayed in a map for the computer game SimCity 2000.","credit":""}]}]},{"paragraph":30,"notes":[{"type":"image","notes":[{"url":"SIA2012-9669-downsampled.jpg","alt":"","caption":"","credit":"SIA Image negative reference number: SIA2012-9669"}]}]},{"paragraph":40,"notes":[{"type":"image","notes":[{"url":"SIA2012-9670-downsampled.jpg","alt":"","caption":"","credit":"SIA Image negative reference number: SIA2012-9670"},{"url":"SIA2012-9671-downsampled.jpg","alt":"","caption":"","credit":"SIA Image negative reference number: SIA2012-9671"},{"url":"SIA2012-9672-downsampled.jpg","alt":"","caption":"","credit":"SIA Image negative reference number: SIA2012-9672"}]}]},{"paragraph":49,"notes":[{"type":"image","notes":[{"url":"SigPuzzle.png","alt":"","caption":"On the outer page of the whole document, there is an interesting note, which suggests that copyright for the prophecy was filed 30 May 1867, under two names – what could be Chen han-sen, and what might be John O Wheeleeock.","credit":"SIA Image negative reference number: SIA2012-9672"}]}]}]
