From its beginning in the 1640s, George Fox and other leading Quaker ministers emphasized the importance of individual connection to the Inner Light, their term for the Holy Spirit. They taught that the way to achieve this union with the Light was to practice silent contemplation during meetings for worship. Instead of listening to a pre-prepared sermon by an educated minister, any Friend could potentially be moved by the Light during worship to stand and address the group. During the seventeenth century, Quaker silences were nevertheless characterized by ecstatic worship practices; the name “Quakers” came from the way that they shook and quaked when filled with the Holy Spirit.

In theory, any Friend could speak if they felt so compelled but in practice recognized ministers spoke most frequently. They were also most likely to leave behind an account of their experiences because they often wrote about their ministerial journeys. Though Quaker journals followed a general formula, individual ministers frequently embellished their narratives with reflections on theology and Quaker worship practices, making them a good source of information about the internal, individual experience of silence during worship."]},{"type":"citation","notes":["Howard H.

The difference for them would have been that their sermons were unprepared, and that they did not have formal ministerial training. Additionally, they believed that spending too much time on doctrinal discussions distracted Friends from true worship. Beginning in the early nineteenth century, Hicks would come into conflict with Friends who had been influenced by their interactions with evangelical groups and therefore wanted to impose stricter doctrinal standards on the Society of Friends as a whole.
