Both instruments allow only two different pitches to be struck simultaneously and this feature is built into early _sandaya_ music. The piano’s unique ability to imitate those traditional instruments was likely part of its appeal."]},{"type":"link","notes":[{"label":"Kit Young, “The Strange, The Familiar: Foreign Musical Instruments in Myanmar/Burma”, 2003.","url":"http://asiasociety.org/arts/performing-arts/music/strange-familiar-foreign-musical-instruments-myanmarburma"}]}]},{"paragraph":16,"notes":[{"type":"commentary","notes":["This scale was realized roughly on the piano by lowering the pitch of the E keys, raising the F keys, and then doing the same for B and A, respectively.
