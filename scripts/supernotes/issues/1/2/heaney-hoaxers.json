His moon series had been an attempt to lampoon their beliefs, and teach the public to study nature without blinders, but he had <i>written it so well</i> that the fantasy landed, but the satire hadn’t. “I am unaffectedly ashamed of it,” wrote Locke, “not from any casuistry about it as a hoax, but because, in this very respect, it is so bungling a production.”<br /><br />In explaining the textual inspiration for Locke’s moon series—from the discoveries of John Herschel to the widespread appreciation of those religious astronomers—Goodman makes an excellent case for Locke’s attempt at satire. Yet at no point at the time, it seems, did Locke gesture in those directions. I tend to believe that Locke, as a writer, did indeed begin with a satire of religious astronomy, but, as an editor, he put it to two very different non-exclusive purposes: first and most obviously, to cause a sensation and raise the circulation of <i>The Sun</i>, making money for himself, temporarily, and for his publisher, over time. And second, I think he was genuinely waging war on New York’s mounting crusade against abolition’s crusaders by other, lighter means. Writing about man-bats on the moon was not writing about slavery—but ‘not writing about slavery,’ in such a charged moment, was <i>also</i> writing about slavery.<br /><br /><i>That’s sophistry.</i><br />A book bound with cotton is also a slave on his stomach, breathing lightly, hoping the wounds across his spine might heal.<br />In any case, even if the Moon Hoax wasn’t about abolition, it began in the midst of it, and was, strangely, marshaled to its cause. There were might not have been Paradise on the moon, but nor were there any lynchings."]},{"type":"citation","notes":["Goodman, <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/176894745\">_The Sun and the Moon</a>, pp. 221-222."]}]},{"paragraph":62,"notes":[{"type":"commentary","notes":["The scene following, unless otherwise noted, is drawn from “Court of Oyer and Terminer and Circuit,” <em>The New York Sun</em>, 23 September 1835."]},{"type":"citation","notes":["“Court of Oyer and Terminer and Circuit,” <em>The Sun</em>, 23 September 1835."]}]},{"paragraph":71,"notes":[{"type":"citation","notes":["“Trial and Conviction for Murder,” <em>NY Commercial Adviser</em>, 23 September 1835."]}]},{"paragraph":73,"notes":[{"type":"commentary","notes":["For Locke’s apartment location, and birthday, see Goodman, <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/176894745\"><em>The Sun and the Moon</em></a>, pp. 49, 80."]}]},{"paragraph":76,"notes":[{"type":"citation","notes":["Richard Adams Locke, <em>The Life and Adventures of Manuel Fernandez, Otherwise Richard C.
