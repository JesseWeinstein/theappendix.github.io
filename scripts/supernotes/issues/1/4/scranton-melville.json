It will then be clear that language is a complex system, in which various elements are at work, whose combinations produce words, sentences, paragraphs, or chapters. Obviously, nothing prevents us from studying the behavior, in every possible circumstance, of each of these elements. On the contrary, it is only in this manner that experimental research into the possibilities of language can proceed” (Bénabou, Marcel, “Rule and Constraint” in <em>Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature</em>, edited by Warren F.
