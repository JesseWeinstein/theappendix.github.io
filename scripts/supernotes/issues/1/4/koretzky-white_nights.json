As Dostoevsky’s Underground Man notes, Petersburg was built virtually overnight because of the will of one man, Peter the Great. The building of Petersburg was notoriously difficult—a vast number of serfs died digging the canals and laying the foundations that transformed swampy islands into habitable land. The city continued to expand after it was founded in the early 1700s. The construction of a canal bisecting the western half of Vasilevsky Island in the mid-twentieth century made it possible to start development in this sector of the city.","<em>Remont</em> is a Russian word meaning “renovation,” but with a much wider usage than the English equivalent. For example, signs cautioning pedestrians about road work or building repairs use this word. Walter Benjamin comments on the usage of this word in <em>Moscow Diary</em> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1986)."]},{"type":"citation","notes":["Elif Batuman, <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/417444181\"><em>The Possessed: Adventures with Russian Books and the People Who Read Them</em></a> (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2010), pp. 180-212.","Solomon Volkov, <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32703508\"><em>St Petersburg: A Cultural History</em></a> (Free Press, 2010)."]}]}]
