[{"paragraph":1,"notes":[{"type":"commentary","notes":["Much was made of this difference a few years ago in an article by Rafael E. Núñez and Eve Sweetser: “With the Future Behind Them: Convergent Evidence From Aymara Language and Gesture in the Crosslinguistic Comparison of Spatial Construals of Time,” <em>Cognitive Science</em> 30 (2006), 29. To wit:<br /><br />«In Example 3 (male speaker, 73, from Pachama; bilingual interview), the speaker is talking about his “ancestors” (<em>achachilas</em>) when the interviewer suggests that this might have been the time of the Incas (<em>gentil timpu</em>). The speaker, who is thinking of more immediate ancestors such as great-grandparents, responds … “That is even further away before,” meaning that the Incas existed far earlier than what he is talking about. He gestures with both hands, an alternating rotating gesture upward and away from the body.»<br /><br />As to why, the authors suggested that it may partly come from the emphasis the Aymara language puts on visual perception as a source of knowledge. It turns out that Aymara is a historian’s dream language, distinguishing between firsthand knowledge and secondhand knowledge. If we are describing an event that we had witnessed, the grammatical construction –<em>Vna</em> is added to the sentence; if we’ve only heard about it, <em>-tayna</em> is added."]}]}]
