The minutes of the NSC meeting do not list Kennerly as a participant or note his contribution to the discussion. Kennerly’s outburst is, however, documented in the unofficial record. Both Ford and Kennerly mention it in their memoirs, although they recall it differently. The unofficial record is then both more and less reliable than its official counterpart. Indispensable for the historian, it reveals what the official record tends to elide, including “water cooler” discussions that take place outside of earshot of the designated note-taker, unspoken or unspeakable motivations, and personal conflicts. But because the unofficial record rejects the imperative of standardization, its treasures are always open to question. For the unofficial record of NSC meeting of May 14, 1975 on the <em>Mayaguez</em> crisis see, among others, Ford, <em>A Time to Heal</em> and Kennerly, <em>Shooter</em>. For the official record see “Minutes of National Security Council Meeting,” in US Department of State, <em>Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969-1976.
