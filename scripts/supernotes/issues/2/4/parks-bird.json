She could be dismissive, especially of other religions (being a devout Christian) but also wrote beautifully and respectfully of Buddhist traditions. Her translators and servants have starring roles in most of her accounts, but her views were often imperialistic even when she rejoiced in the kindness and intelligence of foreign cultures. In one telling moment, she began a letter to her sister by saying, “This cannot be a “great” letter because one native state is so like another and there is now very little to say.” She then wrote 116 pages and was moved to cross out her opening line."]},{"type":"citation","notes":["Isabella Bird. <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/hwap10h.htm\"><em>The Hawaiian Archipelago</em></a>, Letter IX.
