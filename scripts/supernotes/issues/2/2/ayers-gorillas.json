This large group of Bantu speakers inhabit the interior forests of Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. <br /> Historian Mary Louise Pratt argues that Du Chaillu, among others, unconsciously used his ‘hyphenated status’ (determined by race and social class) to inform his interpretations of Africa. It is common knowledge that Western explorers defined their whiteness, masculinity, and general superiority against the savage, ape-like, and deviant ‘other.’ It should be said, though, that studying on-the-ground interactions with the Fang tends to complicate Pratt’s theory.
