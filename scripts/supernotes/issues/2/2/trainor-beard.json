Using the word-searchable digital database <em>America’s Historical Newspapers</em> (a standard source for scholars of eighteenth and nineteenth-century America, which contains digitized versions of thousands of the newspapers in the collection of the American Antiquarian Society in Worcester, Massachusetts), I entered the search terms ‘abraham lincoln whiskers’ and ‘abraham lincoln beard,’ limiting both searches to the years 1859 through 1861, and permitting only those results categorized as ‘news/opinion.’ While the former search returned 148 results compared to a mere 33 for the latter, it soon became clear that, in the overwhelming majority of cases, the optical character recognition software had mistaken ‘heard’ or ‘board’ for ‘beard.’ As a result, fewer than ten of the 148 results actually deal with facial hair, and, of these, only two with Lincoln’s. It’s also clear from the contents of these two articles that neither of their authors had actually seen Lincoln’s facial hair in person. Of the 33 results for ‘abraham lincoln whiskers,’ on the other hand, 16 refer to specifically to Lincoln’s appearance."]}]},{"paragraph":17,"notes":[{"type":"citation","notes":["Edgar A.
