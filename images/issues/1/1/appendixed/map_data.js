        description: "Born in 1782, William Miller was a Baptist preacher who attracted a considerable following during the era of the Second Great Awakening. Miller preached an apocalyptic, millenarian interpretation of Biblical scripture and came to believe that the second coming would arrive in 1844. After the “Great Disappointment” that followed his failed apocalyptic prediction, a splinter group of Millerites formed the Seventh Day Adventists. See <a href='http://theappendix.net/articles/2#supernotes-paragraph-27'>here</a> for more on the Millerites.",

The key to understanding time was figuring out how the Old Testament prefigured the history of Christianity, from Christ to the present.”  Fiore (1135-1202 CE) analyzed the Book of Revelations and concluded that a “Third Age” would come in 1260 CE which would radically transform human societies.",

The West Coast would disappear, Mexico would be absorbed, and the Caribbean would become an American lake—again, a literal one. The cataclysm would then set the stage for a final battle between the U.S. and the Catholic countries of the world.”",

For the inhabitants of Ur, it truly was the end of the world—or, at least, of <i>their</i> world. Remembering the disaster decades later, the survivors produced some of the earliest poetry in the historical record. These poems are dark lamentations, frightening, violent and nihilistic in tone.” Despite Ur’s importance as an early urban center, much of its culture and language was lost following this disastrous invasion.",

Left out of this equation, however, are the hominid species who once co-existed with modern humans. These cousins of humanity did, in fact, witness true apocalypses. In 2003, the remains of one possible such species, dubbed <i>Homo floriensis</i> were discovered in a cave on the island of Flores in Indonesia. These people may have survived until circa 13000-12000 BCE, well into the era of anatomically modern humans.",

He believed that he would play a pivotal role in the pre-apocalyptic Second Coming of Christ, and linked this personal mystical belief to contemporaneous English attempts to discover a Northwest Passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Believing that the discovery of this passage would lead to the conversion of the world’s peoples to a new form of Christian faith, Dee chartered a “Fellowship of New Navigations Atlanticall” for “North-West streights discoverie” in 1583. Although the fellowship folded within a year, a similar charter was won by Dee’s friend, Sir Walter Raleigh. The result was the founding of Jamestown, Virginia in 1585.",
